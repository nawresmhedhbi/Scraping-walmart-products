# Scraping-walmart-products

In this project, It was difficult to scrape data from Walmart because the website blocks scraping which make the Walmart website not accessible, so I looked at server response and extracted data from it. It was the best method to succeed in the project since it looks at the API that the website took the information from, we replicate the requests before getting into python and get blocked, also keep the cookies so we canâ€™t get blocked.

### Files:
